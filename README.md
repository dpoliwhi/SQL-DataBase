Information about each table, relationship and constraints you can find in *materials* or by this [link](https://github.com/dpoliwhi/SQL-DataBase/blob/master/materials/tables_info.md "tables_info.md")

## Part 1. Creating a database

Written a *part1.sql* script that creates the database and all the tables described above.


Also, add procedures to the script that allow you to import and export data for each table from/to a file with a *.csv* extension. \
The *csv* file separator is specified as a parameter of each procedure.

In each of the tables, enter at least 5 records.
As you progress through the task, you will need new data to test all of your choices.
This new data needs to be added to this script as well.

If *csv* files were used to add data to the tables, they must also be uploaded to the GIT repository.

*All tasks must be named in the format of names for School 21, for example A5_s21_memory. \
In the future, Whether a task belongs to a block will be determined by the name of the block in the task name, e.g. "CPP3_SmartCalc_v2.0" belongs to the CPP block. \*
